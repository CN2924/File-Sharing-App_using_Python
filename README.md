A peer to peer sharing application, developed for, Internet Protocols.

This application is a P2P file sharing system with a centralized index (CI).

  Project goals:
  
* Getting familiarized with network programming and the socket interface.
  
* Creating server processes that wait for connections.
  
* Creating client processes that contact a well-known server and exchange data over the Internet.
  
* In a deinitioned manner it's a simple application protocol and making sure that peers and server follow precisely the specifications for their side of the protocol in order to accomplish particular tasks.
  
* Implementing a concurrent server that is capable of carrying out communication with multiple clients simultaneously.
  
* Creating and managing a centralized index at the server based on information provided by the peers.
