The Network Working Group seems to consist of Steve Carr of Utah, Jeff
Rulifson and Bill Duvall at SRI, and Steve Crocker and Gerard Deloche
at UCLA.  Membership is not closed.

The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software, the
strategies for using the network, and initial experiments with the network.

Documentation of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes
may be produced at any site by anybody and included in this series.
